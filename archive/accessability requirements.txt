### **Accessibility Requirements for Websites in Israel (Including Video Game Sites)**  

In Israel, the **Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities Law, 1998** and its **Accessibility Regulations for Online Services (2013)** require websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. These regulations are based on the **WCAG 2.0 AA (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** standard and apply to most public websites.

## **1️⃣ Does This Law Apply to Video Game Websites?**  
**Yes**, if your game is publicly available online, it is considered a "service provided to the public" and must comply with accessibility laws.  
However, if your game is private (e.g., an internal app, a beta version for a closed audience), the requirement may not apply.  

### **Who Must Comply?**
- Websites that provide **information, entertainment, or commerce** to the public.  
- Online services, including **gaming platforms, educational sites, and interactive experiences**.  
- Businesses with revenue exceeding **1,063,000 NIS per year** (as of 2023) must **fully comply**. Smaller businesses may have fewer requirements.

## **2️⃣ What Are the Key Accessibility Requirements?**  

Your game’s website must follow **WCAG 2.0 AA** guidelines. This includes:  

### **Visual Accessibility (For Users with Low Vision or Blindness)**
✅ **Keyboard Navigation** – The entire game must be operable without a mouse.  
✅ **Text Resizing** – Users must be able to enlarge text without breaking the layout.  
✅ **Color Contrast** – Text must have enough contrast against its background.  
✅ **Screen Reader Support** – Interactive elements should be labeled for screen readers (e.g., using `aria-label`).  

### **Motor Disabilities (For Users with Limited Hand Mobility)**
✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** – Users must be able to play the game with a keyboard alone.  
✅ **Adjustable Controls** – Allow remapping of controls for easier access.  
✅ **No Time-Dependent Input** – Players must have enough time to react.  

### **Cognitive Disabilities (For Users with ADHD, Dyslexia, etc.)**
✅ **Avoid Blinking and Flashing** – No excessive animations that could trigger seizures.  
✅ **Simplified Navigation** – Clear menus, structured content, and readable fonts.  
✅ **Error Assistance** – Explain errors and provide solutions (e.g., “Invalid password – must be 8 characters”).
