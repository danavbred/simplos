URGENT: LEADERBOARDS ERROR



Test Level Consistency


Standardize how all test levels (3,6,9,10,13,16,19,20,21) handle mixed Hebrew/English questions
Implement consistent speed challenge mechanics across levels 10, 20, and 21
Add visual indicators for when a level is a test level vs. learning level
This would make the game's pedagogical structure more clear to players

Progress and Reward System


Adjust coin rewards based on level type (learning/test/boss)
Create special achievements for completing boss levels
Implement a "mastery" system that tracks performance across test levels
Add bonus rewards for completing all sets in a stage
This would make progression more meaningful


1. move supabase secret into a separate env file for security.
2. divide css html script into separate files just for better handling
3. have a admin panel as separate app + wp buttons for direct comm
admin panel to manually add/edit/delete users, confirm teacher stat, confirm payments. 


4. IMPORTANT! GOING TO PAGE URL ASKS IF USER WANTS TO HAVE APP ICON INSTALLED FOR THEM ON DESKTOP FOR EASIER ACCESS. IT ASKS ONE TIME AND THERE SHOULD BE A MEASURE THAT IT DOESNT ASK WHEN NOT REQUIRED ANYMORE.
5. consolidate the stage screen + set screen into a single screen where pressing a stage button makes it collapse and show the sets.this uld be the game map.

here is a sketch of it: 

level map: currently the game is built up of levels, contained in sets, contained in stages which are accessed progressively. I want to preserve the current logic and functionality but organize the visibility of the stages and sets better. So the level map button leads to the set screen and clicking each set shows the levels contained within it. In the code, you will notice there is also a stage screen that is currently accessible from nowhere. I want to unify the stage and set screens to a combined one as follows. Each stage is a regtancle, not a square. They are stacked vertically one above the other. Clicking a stage remains in the same screen, but the stage button uncollapses to reveal the sets within it, including how many were so far opened. The game map button from the welcoem screen should lead to this combined screen, and lets preserve its name as set screen, but bring in there the five buttons from the stage screen. For logistical reasons, dont terminate the stage screen to avoid code avalanche.

6. add a shop and more perks users can buy - the actual game should have less money and perks should be higher prices. Game time should be less time for extra stress.
7. level 21 of each set should be a boss level - see below some ideas 
8. an xp system where each learned word is an experience point.
9. leaderboards and player stats.

10. movement between levels: 

in the movement from one level to the next, there is a curtain animation that falls, announces the following level, then lifts and the next level begins. I want to simplify. Instead of this: 

When player is in the welcome screen and  presses start game,  let the curtain show as before. But in-game, the movement between levels should be without curtain at all. Instead, when last level question is answered correctly, the circular progress bar empties, the bar pulses and there is a small particle effect. (current state)  to this I want you to add the following sequence: 

in the place where the last question  word used to be, show the following level, make it pulse once dramatically, and together with it, all the letter particles in the background should shine bright for a moment, together with it. Then, the next level name disappears, and the following level starts. Without any screen transitions. It should be a very smooth transition. Can you handle this?

11. develop a simplos for schools where teachers can share custom lists, students cant.
create classes, add button "my classes" teacher can see on share panel both individuals and classes, add a filter for quicker browsing. student view: join class with code. teacher view: classes as items, each with code that can be shared + qr. teacher can share list to class, then all students who join this class can see the lists associated with this class.

teacher panel - separate app - track and share
option to open on screen from teacher's panel a Socrative type screen for ghost updating leaderboard and class competitions. show a graph, or list of usernames - and progress that updates once a minute 

install a Duolingo-like ghost tracking where students can compete in class after joining a lobby panel like in kahoot or blooket crypto.

12. optimize the entire app better for mobile

13. later, nice to have but not super urgent: 

one-on-one: two players compete, either two friends or two students at school




boss level ideas

Boss Level UI Enhancement


Add unique visual and audio feedback for the boss level
Create a special introduction screen/curtain animation specifically for level 21
Add a "Boss Battle" progress indicator different from the regular circle
Include a special victory animation for completing a boss level
This would make level 21 feel more significant and rewarding

Performance Optimization for Boss Level


Implement word preloading for level 21 since it uses all words
Add progress caching for boss battles in case of disconnection
Optimize the UI rendering for handling large word sets
This would ensure smooth gameplay even with full vocabulary sets

particle background like warp space

Words fade out gradually as time passes, adding urgency
Answers shuffle positions every few seconds
In each answer choice, random letters begin to fade
Decreasing time limit for each successive question
perks dont work in boss level
Double-speed timer during certain "intense" phases
Questions alternate between Hebrew and English randoml
Periodic "lightning strikes" that briefly scramble the interfac
"Poison" effect where screen gradually darkens until next correct answer
Multiple words appear simultaneously, must match pairs correctly
Words appear from different directions, testing peripheral vision

Visual Indicators:

Special boss level icon in level select screen
Dramatic entrance animation when level begins
Unique color scheme specific to boss levels

Visual Design Elements:
Dark, intense background gradient (deep purples and crimsons)
Pulsing border around the screen that intensifies as time decreases
"Warning" style interface with hazard stripes and flashing elements
Dramatic particle effects on correct/incorrect answers
Screen shake effects during critical moments
Progress circle becomes more elaborate with multiple rotating rings

Boss "health bar" at top of screen representing progress
