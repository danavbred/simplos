Key idea: produce only functions that correlate with the preexisting arcade sql. Reuse and repurpose from the main game the leaderboard and game logic components, we're creating an arcade variant mode!

The arcade is a moderator handled session based variant of the existing game using its own logic, but branching out of the same original game. Therefore, where possible to use a logic and code that is already there, repurpose it.

We will progress very slowly and methodically, all the time making sure were in line with the arcade sql:

-- ARCADE TABLES
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS arcade_events CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS arcade_participants CASCADE;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS arcade_events (
    moderator_name text NOT NULL,
    access_code text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    status text DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'completed')),
    word_pool jsonb,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
        event_name text NOT NULL,
    id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS arcade_participants (
    id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id uuid REFERENCES arcade_events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    player_name text NOT NULL,
    words_completed integer DEFAULT 0,
    coins integer DEFAULT 0,
    perks jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
    rank integer,
    status text DEFAULT 'waiting' CHECK (status IN ('waiting', 'playing', 'finished')),
    joined_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

the first part is this:

1. Add a button  to the welcome screen called Arcade. When user presses it it opens a modal. If player is unregistered or registered with status student, the modal contains Enter OTP, and a Join button.

2. If player is registered with status teacher, the modal shows a random generated otp and a simple lobby-counter that counts how many participants have already joined with the otp. User polling to update the number in real time, you can see them in the supabase arcade participants table. What the otp joins participants to is the arcade event from supabase. The joined participants go into the arcade participants table. 

3. Once player is joined with otp, show a spinner waiting screen with the words "Arcade will begin soon". The screen is z-index above all other screens for the joined participant until arcade begins. If player by mistake left the browser before game began and they still have the same otp, they can still use it, as long as the game hasn't ended. 

4. Once the expected number of joined participants shows on the lobby-counter, modal counter on the teacher's side, teacher can press Initiate button that leads them to a moderator screen. 

Now, the moderator screen is a duplicate of the speedboard screen.

So I expect to see 

1. modal with a teacher variant and a student/unregistered variant.
2. a spinner waiting screen for joined participants. 
3. a moderator screen, as a duplicate of the speedboard screen, with the names of the joined participants on it.

! Important, when teacher presses initiate, the spinner screen continues to show for students and their status is still waiting not playing!

! Important, unregistered joiners get random names from this list: 

'Simplosaurus', 'Simplodian', 'Simpleton', 'Simplonius', 'Simplomancer', 
  'Simplonaut', 'Simplobot', 'Simplozilla', 'Simplopedia', 'Simplotron', 
  'Simplodex', 'Simplomatic', 'Simplomobile', 'Simplocopter', 'Simplonium', 
  'Simplotastic', 'Simplominator', 'Simploverse', 'Simplonado', 'Simplophant', 
  'Simplowizard', 'Simplodragon', 'Simplosapien', 'Simploninja', 'Simplowarrior'

! Important, joined studnets show on supabase arcade participants list. !

on supabase, a table called user profiles shows a role column. The roles are either student or teacher. This is how you know that a user is a teacher and should be shown the teacher's variant of the otp modal. 

! Important, registered users who are status premium (again, check user profiles table), will appear with their username. Also, on the game progress table you can see the details accosiated with a user, and the column that shows the amount of earned coins they have in the main game. I want that amount to show also on the moderator's leaderboard. If player has 75 coins in the main game, and they enter an arcade, they start the arcade session with 75 coins. the coins should update and reflect back to their game progress alternately. Arcades should be a way for a player to earn more coins. 

Make a recommendation: Do you think the arcade sql should be expanded to include user status column? or another element that would make the flow and communication with supabase easier and less risky? if you see redundant columns on the arcade participants/event tables, lets recreate them as simple and uncomplicated as possible for better integration. I dont think we need an event name, for example, the id is enough. In everything we do here, suggest a smart way to handle everything simply, because almost every time I try to integrate this arcade it creates a 400 error, 406, 500, and others.... and if we can put every check possible to prevent running into such complications in advance, all the better. 


So today 8/2 the update is that we have made some extensive progress: 

WHAT WE ACHIEVED:

Successfully moved away from problematic Supabase table operations to Realtime channels
Got the basic arcade flow working:

Teacher sees OTP
Students can join with OTP
Names appear correctly on moderator's leaderboard
Player removal functionality implemented



WHAT'S WORKING:

Modal system for both teacher and student views
Channel-based communication
Player joining and visibility on leaderboard
Basic arcade session management

CURRENT ISSUES:
Word pool generation and stage selection need testing
Test the complete flow:

Word pool generation from selected stages
Actual gameplay mechanics
Coin earning/losing system
Real-time leaderboard updates during play
Game completion conditions


Implement cleanup:

Channel unsubscription when game ends
Proper state reset
Handle disconnections


Future Enhancements:

Add visual feedback for streaks
Implement reconnection logic
Add game statistics for teachers
Consider saving game results for history

For the next chat, you'll need to focus on:

Testing the complete gameplay loop
Fixing any timing issues between moderator and players
Ensuring coin system works properly
Making sure the word pool is correctly generated and distributed
Implementing proper game completion logic
