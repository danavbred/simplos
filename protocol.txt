ok listen the arcade idea is great but something is not working. Its not just the lobby and the spinner screen, its more complicated than what I wanted in general. I want to suggest a new idea. The new idea is all based on components that already exist in the main game and can be repurposed from there.
So I want the teacher to keep being able to produce otp. Now when participants join, they dont have to wait in a lobby and no spinner is required.
Teacher side: same as now, panel to create arcade events, start arcade and ---> new idea
student side: press arcade button, feed otp, join and ----> new idea
new idea: teacher screen shows a leaderboard exactly like the existing speedboard. Only that here everyone can see everyone's names. The joined participants are stacked one above the other in the order of their moment of joining. This has no significance because everyone's card shows 0 points. So this is both the lobby AND the arcade arena screen at the same time .
if you can repurpose the existing pulse screen to actually be removed when teacher presses start arcade, lets try it. When teacher presses start arcade, all students see pulse screen removed, and the question screen begins to throw questions at them. The leaderboard updates their points in PRECISELY how the speedboard does. In fact, if several registered players decided now to play the main game and open an extra screen with the speedboard on so they can follow who is leading real time, this would be it, even without a moderating teacher. Do you see my point?Haiku said:Excellent concept. Here's a strategic breakdown:
1. Teacher Flow:
* Create event with OTP
* Generate leaderboard that starts with participants at 0 points
* "Start Arcade" button removes wait screen for all participants
1. Student Flow:
* Press Arcade button
* Enter OTP
* Immediately see leaderboard with their name added -- no, they need to have a waiting instance before all participants join, but not a spinner screen. Instead, when player feeds the otp it happens on the welcome screen. So lets do it this way: when otp is fed, the screen buttons "start game", "my lists", "game map" and "speedboard" all become disabled. Player STAYS ON WELCOME SCREEN, and instead of the arcade button, now there is a little spinner instead of it! together with the words "Get ready to play!" So the movement from welcome screen to the question screen is seamless and replicates the main game's in-built logic 
* Wait for teacher to start
1. Game Mechanics:
* Use existing speedboard leaderboard component
* Use existing question screen
* Real-time point tracking
* No separate lobby or waiting screens
Key Implementation Steps:
1. Modify joinArcadeEvent() to directly add to leaderboard
2. Modify startArcadeGame() to remove waiting screens
3. Leverage existing showLeaderboard() function
4. Use current point calculation methodsInstead of calling it arena screen, I think what I was after in the first place was called a moderator screen. This is where the teacher sees all joined participants and decides when to start the arcade... the only addition should be that moderator should be able to remove a joined participant before and during gameplay. And one last thing. Player's username is only one of two options: a. a registered user? good! show them their username. b. unregistered, well, the only option is:'Simplosaurus', 'Simplodian', 'Simpleton', 'Simplonius', 'Simplomancer', 
  'Simplonaut', 'Simplobot', 'Simplozilla', 'Simplopedia', 'Simplotron', 
  'Simplodex', 'Simplomatic', 'Simplomobile', 'Simplocopter', 'Simplonium', 
  'Simplotastic', 'Simplominator', 'Simploverse', 'Simplonado', 'Simplophant', 
  'Simplowizard', 'Simplodragon', 'Simplosapien', 'Simploninja', 'Simplowarrior'Before we begin: Ask for clarifications before you begin. I want the arcade to build as much as possible on preexisting components from the main game: the vocabularysets, the coin + perk system, the leaderboard. So this should be very easy to implement. I would also want a clear list of all functions and components of the older idea that should be removed safely without damaging the game;'s logic or functionality. You may repurpose as many of the existing arcade functions as you want, but help me remove the rest. When you want me to ADD a new function that is still not present in the entire code, put ADD in uppercase letters in the header of the function snippet. When you want me to replace a new function that is still not present in the entire code, put REPLACE in uppercase letters in the header of the function snippet. Dont ask me to replace or modify partial segments of long existing functions, and dont tell me "rest of the code remains the same" In such cases, just write the entire function and write REPLACE.EditLet me clarify a few points to ensure we're aligned:

The new arcade flow would be:

Teacher creates event with OTP in teacher panel
Students enter OTP on welcome screen
Students stay on welcome screen with "Get ready" spinner
When teacher starts, students move directly to question screen
Teacher sees real-time progress via speedboard-style display


For the teacher's view:

Uses existing speedboard component structure
Should show all participants
Allow participant removal
Show real-time scores


For player names:

Registered users: Show username
Unregistered: Random "Simplo" name


For game mechanics:

Use existing vocabulary sets
Use existing coin/perk system
Use existing leaderboard mechanics

 I followed your lead on this session but its again a complete waste of quota and precious premium time. I meticulously attach the latest code version and sql and provide you with specific input. I was never interested in scores iin the first place, only in players moving up and down the moderator leaderboard based on number of words they earned. The words are the real scores. The entire code is already shaped around this method, but for some reason you decided you wanted scores, not points. I believe Im entitled to an extra 40 minutes quota now because you wasted my quota pulling in your own direction, "revealing" a score inconsistency when in reality scores were never a goal of this project. 

What I really want? I want you to follow this sql , which is also way too puffed up to serve a simple arcade where we track nothing but players' pseudonames, their ranking, amount of words practiced, and as a side info, how many coins they have - which still doesnt work. 

Shouldnt stripping down to bare bones have started here in the sql in the first place? 

You're absolutely right - I apologize for leading us down the wrong path. Let me outline exactly what happened and what needs to be done:

WHAT WE TRIED AND FAILED:

We got distracted by score implementation when the real focus should have been word completion tracking

The SQL is unnecessarily complex with many unused fields and features

We complicated debugging by focusing on wrong metrics

I ignored the existing codebase design which was already built around word tracking

WHAT MUST BE DONE NEXT:

Strip down SQL to bare essentials:

arcade_events needs only: id, teacher_id, access_code, status, word_pool, translations

arcade_participants needs only: id, event_id, player_name, words_completed, coins

Remove all unused indexes and permissions that complicate things

Fix the core issues:

Update word completion tracking in arcade_participants

Fix coin accumulation (which was your original request)

Focus on moderator view leaderboard based on words_completed

Remove all score-related code that's cluttering the system

Debug Strategy:

Start with reading the words_completed field

Verify coin updates are reaching the database

Test leaderboard sorting by words_completed

NO score tracking, NO streaks, NO unnecessary stats

Specific Actions for Next Chat:

Provide minimalist SQL first

Test basic word completion update

Fix coin updates

Clean up all score-related code

Focus on leaderboard functionality





current situation: We couldnt get the game to work with an arcade system and we decided to simplify and build as much as possible on the main game's logic and preexisting functionality. The result is this:

teacher starts an event, provides otp, student feeds otp and is then in spinner waiting mode. When all players join, teacher initiates game from moderator screen. The start game button moves all joined players from spinner waiting mode into the game. So currently they appeara to be in the actual main game, earning coins but also doing the hardcoded levels of stage 1, going from level 1-1 to 1-2 and so on, getting the signup and upgrade exhort ads...So arcade players are being actually led by the teacher into a session of the main game.

start a logic by which players who enter the game via the teacher's otp dont end up in the main game but in a variation of it, just like a custom word list is defined by slightely different rules but still functions beautifully.

1. let participants earn coins like in the main game, but don't install any point system at all. dont give points, but let players earn 10 coins for correct answer, lose 2 for wrong answer. Good steak - for 3 or more correct answers - 2 more coins for each correct. Bad steak - for 3 or more wrong answers - lose 2 more coins for each wrong.

2. dynamic word sets. Arcade is not a level system. Its more like a single level where the teacher can provide an ever changing amount of words and combine different sources. Teacher can decide that the session is 50 words, or a 100, or 200, and that they would come randomly from both stage 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, or 2,3,4... anything goes. But there should be no clear order, each student gets the next word randomly from within the pool the teacher defined. The session ends only when the first 3 participants reached the teacher defined goal, be it 50/100/200 words or another amount. all of this should be handled and defined by the teacher on the moderator screen just before they hit Start play and initiate the arcade mode.

3.  In arcade game, player doesnt get kicked out of the game for any amount of wrong answers. they simply hang in there and dont earn coins, which leaves them at the bottom of the list.

4. realtime leaderboard! Of course were doing the realtime leaderboard! It can and should be an exact duplicate of the speedboard in both design and behavior. This is the board that Id like to see on the moderator screen and not the current one. The most leading players are those that have reached more words. Regardless, please show also how many coins each player has, and update their increase or decrease in real time, whenever they earn for correct answers or lose for wrong ones, or spend on perks.

5. for the time being, dont touch the perk system for now.

6. for the time being, no time constraints for arcade mode.

Start to produce the full form of all required functions. Specify which are supposed to REPLACE existing ones and which are completely new to the code (ADD). Refer again to the index in the project knowledge so you provide relevant data. Also consult the sql and tell me if the arcade sql needs updating. If so, provide  the arcade sql only once - at the end - fully updated top to bottom, the entire section.


Im looking at the table called game progress which reflects the details collected from participants in the main game. There is a column for coins here that arcade participants miss. There is a column for perks which arcade needs too.

No need for anything else from game progress.

so for participants I want to see, in this order fromo left to right: 

player name, words completed, coins, perks, rank on the moderator board, status, joined at. 

I dont need score, and id + event id can be to the rightmost of the table. 

For arcade events, from left to right: 

event name, moderator name (the username who activates it) access code, status. Rest of details can be to the rightmost.

All arcade sql requirements are here. Anything that wasn't mentioned here should not be part of the sql and all the code should support and be shaped around nothing but this sql.



1. simplify and reorganize the sql - I will first go to the sql tables and check that you recreated them correctly.
2. provide new code to support a simplified, relevant sql
3. remove all unrelated code that is in the way.
